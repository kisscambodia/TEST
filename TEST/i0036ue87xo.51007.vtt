=Hello Mr. Gu=

29
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.400
Today,

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.519
we have invited a mysterious guest,

31
00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:55.120
the CEO of Gu Group
and Xingyun Animation.

32
00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:56.879
He only spent four years

33
00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.720
to turn Gu Group

34
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.239
into a new media group

35
00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.279
which focuses on publishing,
advertising and new media.

36
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.400
He also built

37
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.239
the internationally renowned
Xingyun Animation.

38
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.239
He's Gu Nanzhou.

39
00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.600
Mr. Gu,

40
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.240
welcome to the show.

41
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.279
Do you mind sharing with us the project

42
00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.080
Look at the World from Children's Eyes?

43
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:14.800
Look at the World From Children's Eyes

44
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.919
is one of the most important projects
in Xingyun in the coming years.

45
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.479
All famous authors in Xingyun

46
00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:20.720
will participate

47
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.440
in this charity project

48
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.399
to create stories for children.

49
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.880
Hello.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.559
Mr. Gu,

51
00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:32.639
you have a meeting with
DiffuseStar in the morning

52
00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.800
to discuss the renewal of contract.

53
00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:34.160
I have...

54
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.880
Cancel the meeting.

55
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.000
Terminate the contract.

56
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.613
=Episode 1=

57
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.820

58
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:45.181
(Nancheng Art College)

59
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.820
(Notre Dame Bridge)
(No. 1 Canteen)

60
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.119
Excuse me.

61
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.800
No. 3654. Five cups of milk tea.

62
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.559
Here you go.

63
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.540
(Taste of Love Crepe)

64
00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:01.360
Hi.

65
00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.919
No. N48, six burgers.

66
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.800
(I, Zhou Jianqing,)

67
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.919
(am the best courier)

68
00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.759
(with the highest sales)

69
00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.520
(within 20 km of
University of Nancheng.)

70
00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.880
(I deliver food,)

71
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.600
(run errands, occupy seats, walk dogs,)

72
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.080
(print copies and work as a tutor.)

73
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.039
(All in all,)

74
00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.119
(I can do everything)

75
00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.119
(you want.)

76
00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.000
(Of course)

77
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.559
(all services will be paid.)

78
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.399
The food is here.

79
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.399
Milk tea and rice are on the right.

80
00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.320
Fried chicken and spicy hot pot
are on the left.

81
00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:27.880
Thank you, Jianqing.

82
00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.639
(However,)

83
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.360
(once I become famous in the industry,)

84
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.800
(I'll stop doing these.)

85
00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.600
(I forgot to tell you.)

86
00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.880
(I am a cartoonist.)

87
00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.240
Zhou Jianqing!

88
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.954
(DiffuseStar)

89
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.839
The scriptwriter

90
00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.919
has drafted

91
00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.800
365 Days of a Terminally Ill Girl.

92
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:48.039
Have a look.

93
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.240
After that,

94
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.679
draw the first chapter by this week.

95
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.720
Sure, I'll do it now.

96
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.119
Mr. Liu,

97
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.240
why is the draft different
from the proposal?

98
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.440
Are you sure we want to draw like this?

99
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.559
Didn't you want to draw

100
00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.880
365 Days of a Terminally Ill Girl
so badly?

101
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.200
The proposal didn't mention anything

102
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.480
about a rich male lead

103
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.959
with heritage of eight countries.

104
00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:22.279
He didn't look down on
an Oscar-winning actress, too.

105
00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:24.959
There wasn't a plot of him
falling for the female lead

106
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.679
because she splashed ink on him.

107
00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:27.959
I'll pay you RMB150 per page.

108
00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.760
Deal?

109
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.079
What about the part where the leads

110
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:34.959
top up RMB5 million in
a hospital meal card?

111
00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:35.839
You'll be paid RMB200 per page.

112
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.799
I'll draw it.

113
00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:40.040
I'll definitely draw it
for RMB200 per page!

114
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.920
Mr. Gu.

115
00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.720
What time is the appointment
with DiffuseStar?

116
00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.000
Are you sure you want to terminate
the contract with DiffuseStar?

117
00:04:58.359 --> 00:04:59.480
The condition they're
offering are actually...

118
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480
DiffuseStar only produces

119
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.239
copycats of popular works.

120
00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.519
Even if they manage to get away
with copyright infringement,

121
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.239
what is the value

122
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.880
of producing those works?

123
00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:10.000
However, their speed in covering cost...

124
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.720
For Xingyun to gain a foothold,

125
00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.480
we must produce the finest work.

126
00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:15.440
If we only depend on
garbage to cover our cost,

127
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.239
sooner or later,

128
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.399
Xingyun will be the garbage

129
00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:19.880
that the audience would
like to dispose of.

130
00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:21.920
Let me be frank with you.

131
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.720
I've offered Xingyun

132
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.440
the best terms, seriously.

133
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.440
I've made myself clear.

134
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.079
Xingyun won't publish

135
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.799
DiffuseStar's works.

136
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.000
We must terminate the contract.

137
00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:34.279
Mr. Gu,

138
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.720
I know you have a high standard,

139
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
but the market is getting worse.

140
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.399
The market is getting worse.

141
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:45.320
Yes.

142
00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:46.839
Isn't it because the market

143
00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.920
is only left with this kind of garbage?

144
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.920
I'm sorry.

145
00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:53.920
Xingyun

146
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.799
will not stoop so low.

147
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.880
I'll ask Ms. Jiang to
send you the details

148
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.320
of the termination of contract.

149
00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:02.640
You may just deal with her.

150
00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:04.119
Mr. Gu!

151
00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.760
Mr. Gu!

152
00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.760
Listen to me!

153
00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.200
If you don't like the teenager series,

154
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.000
what about the ones
targeting at female audience?

155
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.519
Please the female audience
and you win the market.

156
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.720
It may help Xingyun

157
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.320
to expand your audience.

158
00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:19.399
Mr. Gu.

159
00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.079
Look.

160
00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:22.559
These are DiffuseStar's
works targeting at females.

161
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.519
We have a strong production team

162
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.040
to consistently

163
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.440
produce the content
for different platforms.

164
00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:34.839
Didn't you read the comments
on your official website?

165
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720
You imitate the original version

166
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.760
but fail to copy its essence.

167
00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:39.200
It is a disaster.

168
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.119
It's brainless and illogical.

169
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.839
You rided on the popularity
of Vampire Hunter,

170
00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.559
but yours failed miserably.

171
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.559
You might as well
send blades to the authors.

172
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.920
Qingqing,

173
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.119
it's good that you're here.

174
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.920
Come here.

175
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.279
You must have heard

176
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:02.839
what Mr. Gu said.

177
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.279
Yes.

178
00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:09.000
Think before you draw next time.

179
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.119
Don't just imitate.

180
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.600
You have to change the style.

181
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.440
Mr. Gu,

182
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.200
am I right?

183
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.600
Work hard.

184
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.079
Don't rush in pursuing success.

185
00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.920
Did you hear him?

186
00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:20.720
You're simply impatient.

187
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.200
For your salary this time,

188
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.160
20% will be deducted.

189
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.839
Also,

190
00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:27.320
if you continue with
this kind of work attitude,

191
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.959
we won't just deduct your salary.

192
00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:30.880
Why are you deducting my salary?

193
00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:33.160
I drew according to
the company's requirements.

194
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.760
Mr. Gu said

195
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.040
you did not meet the requirements.

196
00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:38.640
Mr. Liu,

197
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.480
that's all for now.

198
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.559
Mr. Gu,

199
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.839
there's no rush.

200
00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:43.799
I've booked a private room.

201
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.880
Let's talk while having dinner.

202
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.600
There's no need for that.

203
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.480
I have something else to do.

204
00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:48.839
Mr. Gu.

205
00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:50.600
I told you there's no need for that.

206
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.200
Hello! You stepped on my draft.

207
00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:16.279
So what if I did?

208
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.480
As part of the industry,

209
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.000
shouldn't you respect

210
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.519
our work?

211
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.940
(Paradise Street 19)

212
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.039
Paradise Street 19?

213
00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:40.599
The work of Qin Wenjun in 2001

214
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.320
was Paradise Street 3.

215
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.440
You merely changed the name and number,

216
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.679
yet you claim it as your work.

217
00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:48.599
My Paradise Street is not even...

218
00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:49.479
Save your explanation.

219
00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.960
I don't want to waste my time

220
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.880
on such a useless thing.

221
00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:06.760
For Paradise Street 19,

222
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.320
be it the idea or storyboard,

223
00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:11.640
it was done by me alone
through working overtime.

224
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.400
I didn't copy

225
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.440
nor ride on anyone's fame.

226
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.840
You

227
00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:18.280
must

228
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.840
apologise to me and my work.

229
00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:30.919
Kid,

230
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.919
working hard doesn't mean doing well.

231
00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:36.039
You can choose not to respect me,

232
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.479
but you have to pay for your actions.

233
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.960
A page costs RMB200.

234
00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:43.440
You ruined my three pages.

235
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.119
On top of compensation for mental
anguish and interruption of work,

236
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.880
I'll charge you RMB1,000.

237
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.919
I won't argue with you after you pay.

238
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.559
Why should I listen to you?

239
00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.200
You damaged another person's items.

240
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200
You should compensate me
according to the market rate

241
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.080
of the time the incident occurred.

242
00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.440
If not,

243
00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:00.400
I'll sue you for infringement
of property law.

244
00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:01.840
Just tell me

245
00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:04.119
whether you'll make the compensation.

246
00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:12.520
Just scan it.

247
00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:47.880
You are right.

248
00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.359
DiffuseStar is a trap.

249
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.320
I drew it
according to their requirements,

250
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.479
but after listening to Party A,

251
00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:55.520
they deducted 20% of my salary.

252
00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:57.640
Tell me.

253
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.200
They're heartless, right?

254
00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:00.520
Yes.

255
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.400
They are heartless.

256
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.520
There's also Party A.

257
00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:04.559
His surname is Gu.

258
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.359
You don't know how arrogant he was.

259
00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:10.599
He stepped on my drafts
and left without a word.

260
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.159
If I wasn't rational,

261
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.919
he would have been killed.

262
00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:15.840
Yes.

263
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.880
It'd serve him right.

264
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.559
Although

265
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.440
they are evil,

266
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.000
I'm kind.

267
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.840
I won't deduct

268
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.000
your pay as an assistant.

269
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.520
Thank you, Qingqing.

270
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.760
Watch your manners.

271
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.440
Call me "senior" when
we're talking about pay.

272
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.599
Senior.

273
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.719
Please have red date tea.

274
00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:45.440
You are so young

275
00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:47.280
yet you care about your health.

276
00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.760
I'm doing it for
someone's amount of hair.

277
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.760
The teacher is here.

278
00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:08.919
Zhou Jianqing.

279
00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:13.799
Yes.

280
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.359
Based on the previous lecture

281
00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:19.119
about Nanfeng Tower,

282
00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:21.080
talk about the things to note

283
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.760
while designing a high-rise building.

284
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.000
This was the will left by
Mr. Gu five years ago.

285
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.479
Mr. Gu left you

286
00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:33.880
10% of Gu's shares.

287
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.880
(Will of Equity Donation of Gu's Group)

288
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.719
Just transfer the shares to me.

289
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.320
Other than that,

290
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.200
Mr. Gu also left you a letter.

291
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.520
He hoped

292
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:45.239
you could take good care of his
friend's daughter, Zhou Jianqing.

293
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.280
Zhou Jianqing?

294
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:52.840
Therefore,

295
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.679
structure load ratio of steel frame beam

296
00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:56.880
and core tube shear wall

297
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.840
should be taken into consideration.

298
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.760
Combine it with simulation
experiment data

299
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.640
before finalising it.

300
00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:04.719
Good!

301
00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:07.159
Good!

302
00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:10.880
Good!

303
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.200
Excellent.

304
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.440
What an excellent answer from Zhou.

305
00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:17.000
I think you should be

306
00:13:17.479 --> 00:13:18.520
the class representative
for this semester.

307
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.359
Your minor might become your major.

308
00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:34.359
I'm unlucky.

309
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.400
Qingqing!

310
00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:40.440
Zhang Yin, you are here, too.

311
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.599
Your brother sent the parcel
to my house again.

312
00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.400
Why does he always
put the wrong address?

313
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.599
I need to send him stuff
that's good for his brain.

314
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.239
Chocolate?

315
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.640
There's this, too.

316
00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:57.880
Didn't we get a lucky draw voucher

317
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.520
at the supermarket?

318
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.200
I passed by today

319
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.840
and saw the results of the lucky draw.

320
00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:06.400
That's a lot of money.

321
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.080
It's RMB5,000.

322
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.799
It's a grand prize.

323
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.799
I was worried about the material
cost for my final year project

324
00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:15.080
and here comes the prize.

325
00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:16.880
Zhou Jianqing is going to start
her final year project.

326
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.559
Pass her the money.

327
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.760
Don't let her know that I am back.

328
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.320
Don't you know that

329
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.799
I'm not good at lying?

330
00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:25.599
Can you stop asking me

331
00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:27.440
to do such things?

332
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.159
I have no choice.

333
00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:29.599
I'm only close to you.

334
00:14:29.599 --> 00:14:30.719
Who else can do it?

335
00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:32.320
I got it.

336
00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.679
I won't tell her.

337
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.479
Is it for Qingqing?

338
00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:39.919
Didn't you post on Moments

339
00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:41.719
that you would like to try
the macaron from this shop?

340
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.200
I wanted to mail it to you.

341
00:14:43.479 --> 00:14:43.919
Just nice.

342
00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:45.200
I even saved the postage.

343
00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:47.599
I'm leaving!

344
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.320
I got another lucky draw
voucher yesterday.

345
00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:03.320
Follow me to see the results later.

346
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.960
Aren't you working later?

347
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.960
You're getting late.

348
00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.400
If I'm late for five minutes,
RMB50 will be deducted.

349
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.440
Girls,

350
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.159
I shall go first.

351
00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:16.840
Walk slowly!

352
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.080
Senior,

353
00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:23.000
you didn't win the grand prize, right?

354
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.479
No worries.

355
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.239
I won't tell Qingqing.

356
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.440
Was it from Xuan again?

357
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.799
If you were not willing to do it,

358
00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:35.200
why didn't you just reject him?

359
00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:41.000
I shall go to my thesis
advice course now.

360
00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:50.119
(Gu Group Headquarters)
Why isn't Mr. Gu here yet?

361
00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:51.880
It is an important meeting.

362
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.080
Why is he assigning you
as a representative again?

363
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.359
Is it because he is
too busy with Xingyun

364
00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:56.440
and can't attend this again?

365
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.280
I have a suggestion.

366
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.000
In the next shareholder meeting,

367
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.679
replace the CEO of Gu Group.

368
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.520
Lu Ziming is buying a lot
of Gu's shares.

369
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.159
It seems he's planning

370
00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:15.039
to challenge you in
the shareholder meeting.

371
00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:17.559
How many does he have now?

372
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.440
Including the shares that he just bought

373
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.320
and the shares

374
00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:23.200
from a few shareholders
who are working with him,

375
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.520
he has a similar amount as yours.

376
00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:25.960
It's possible for him

377
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.919
to force us out

378
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.159
and get the decision-making
power of Gu Group.

379
00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:32.640
Mr. Gu.

380
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.000
Mr. Gu.

381
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.359
This is the information
of Zhou Jianqing.

382
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.159
(It's her.)

383
00:16:49.719 --> 00:16:51.000
Lu Ziming is still fighting
for the shares.

384
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.960
Why must you look for her now?

385
00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:58.239
Mr. Gu and his friend Zhou Mingyong

386
00:16:58.239 --> 00:17:00.320
established Gu Group together.

387
00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.679
Although they went their separate ways,

388
00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:06.160
Mr. Zhou helped your father

389
00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:07.719
to survive the most
challenging days of Gu Group.

390
00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:12.920
Mr. Gu was very thankful
to the Zhou family.

391
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.280
He even hoped that

392
00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:19.959
you could marry Zhou Jianqing.

393
00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:21.880
However, he passed away suddenly

394
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:24.079
and he didn't manage to
pass you the letter.

395
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.680
The brother and sister of Zhou are not
doing well in recent years.

396
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.319
Since the Zhou family was kind to us,

397
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.199
I can't just ignore them.

398
00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:37.640
Moreover,

399
00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.239
this was my father's will.

400
00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.079
Then

401
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.680
are you going to marry her

402
00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:45.680
because of the will?

403
00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:48.119
Great.

404
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.599
Both of you are single.

405
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.000
She was chosen by your father anyway.

406
00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:53.680
Mr. Gu, I'll give you my blessing.

407
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.119
Good luck.

408
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.680
I have no time to date.

409
00:18:01.359 --> 00:18:03.280
Can I just propose?

410
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.520
No way.

411
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.640
I shall

412
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.280
take care of it.

413
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:08.813
(Artisan Brunch)

414
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:09.800
Based on my investigation,

415
00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:12.359
Zhou Jianqing's mother
had a lot of debts

416
00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:13.520
after taking over the business.

417
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.599
The creditors even approached

418
00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:16.719
and harassed Zhou Jianqing recently.

419
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.599
This is your perfect opportunity
to make a grand entrance.

420
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.199
I'm sorry.

421
00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.479
We're closed.

422
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.479
The most important thing
of courting a girl

423
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.760
is to do what she likes.

424
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.439
The most classic scene in an idol drama

425
00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:38.760
is how the guy saves the beauty

426
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.719
and they fall in love at first sight.

427
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.479
On a rainy night,

428
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:46.880
a girl

429
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.239
is harassed by the creditors

430
00:18:48.439 --> 00:18:49.359
and she encounters danger.

431
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:50.680
She tries to run away,

432
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.880
but the bad guys are still chasing her.

433
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.000
When she is feeling hopeless

434
00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:01.239
and terrified,

435
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.319
you,

436
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.280
the perfect and handsome CEO,

437
00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:06.920
appear like a god

438
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.640
in front of her

439
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.640
and get rid of all the bad guys.

440
00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:19.160
At that moment,

441
00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:21.920
you radiantly appear in front of her

442
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.640
and she'll be moved

443
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.800
by your manly charm.

444
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.079
A miracle will happen by then.

445
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.640
You even have rescuer.

446
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.040
Guys, attack!

447
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.760
(I didn't expect that)

448
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.839
(the scene of a CEO saving a beauty)

449
00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:57.079
(would happen to me.)

450
00:19:58.599 --> 00:19:59.920
(No wonder the audiences like it.)

451
00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:04.880
(My heartbeat is becoming faster.)

452
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.239
Why are you looking at me?

453
00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.079
Well,

454
00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:27.760
thank you.

455
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.040
Why are you here?

456
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.599
I was looking for you.

457
00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:37.239
You're looking for me?

458
00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:38.680
Yes, I was looking for you.

459
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.680
What do you want?

460
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.359
Marry me.

461
00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:46.000
Although I accept any kind of job,

462
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.920
I won't simply marry anyone.

463
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400
You have two choices.

464
00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:50.319
First,

465
00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:51.280
marry me.

466
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.520
What about the second choice?

467
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.599
Register marriage with me.

468
00:20:56.439 --> 00:20:58.040
What's the difference?

469
00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.280
If you agree to my request,

470
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.319
I'll try my best to take care of you.

471
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.239
You won't face the same danger again.

472
00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:06.920
I can solve the problem

473
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.839
that your brother caused

474
00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:10.560
after signing the guaranty
agreement for your mother.

475
00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:13.160
How did you know that?

476
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.400
What are you trying to do?

477
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.119
What are you doing?

478
00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:26.400
Don't mess around.

479
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.359
Let me tell you.

480
00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:29.160
Although I am poor,

481
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.040
I won't prostitute myself.

482
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.439
Don't come over!

483
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.160
I just wanted to keep
you warm with clothes.

484
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.640
Let me tell you.

485
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.040
After

486
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.760
beating up the gangsters,

487
00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:47.439
he asked me to get into his car.

488
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.119
I was stunned.

489
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.680
He even carried me to his car.

490
00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:52.520
In the car, he suddenly asked me

491
00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.920
whether I wanted to marry him.

492
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.160
Marry him?

493
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.239
Wasn't he trying to
take advantage of you?

494
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.640
I saw on news two days ago that

495
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.239
someone tried to use marriage
as an excuse to cheat a girl.

496
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.319
I didn't bother arguing with him.

497
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.760
I just slapped him.

498
00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.199
I ran away

499
00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:10.160
when he was stunned.

500
00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:11.920
Are you all right?

501
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.640
Have you taken care of your injuries?

502
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.839
I'm fine.

503
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:15.680
No worries.

504
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.680
Other than sending you the parcel,

505
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.560
did my brother say anything?

506
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.640
No.

507
00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:28.800
What's wrong?

508
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.239
He didn't reply to my messages

509
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.040
and emails.

510
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.880
I wonder

511
00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:39.359
where he is.

512
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.760
I...

513
00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:44.560
He rarely says anything to me.

514
00:22:48.439 --> 00:22:49.760
Why is there a local label

515
00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:52.839
on the chocolate?

516
00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:54.280
Did he get me

517
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.680
a box of rejected chocolate?

518
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.400
Can you guys stop sending flowers

519
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.239
when you date?

520
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.359
Moreover, you sent such
a big bouquet of flowers.

521
00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:11.920
If I receive this again,

522
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.839
I'll deduct your mark.

523
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.239
I'm sorry, aunt.

524
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.599
Mr. Gu.

525
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.040
Have you sent the flowers?

526
00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:23.040
The flowers have been received.

527
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400
Is there any other way?

528
00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:27.959
Females are pickier in food

529
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.680
than males.

530
00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:31.920
The excitement that they get from food

531
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.959
is stronger than the way
males feel about food.

532
00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:36.280
It won't go wrong

533
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.800
if you send her good food.

534
00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:41.239
Hi, Miss. Zhou.

535
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.119
Mr. Gu has prepared

536
00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:44.400
luxurious seafood lunch for you.

537
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.319
Look.

538
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.300
(My love for you is like wind)

539
00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.000
Who sent you

540
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.719
so much good food?

541
00:23:58.719 --> 00:24:00.359
When a girl is protected
and taken care of,

542
00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:02.199
oxytocin, which is also
known as love stimulant

543
00:24:02.439 --> 00:24:04.599
is produced.

544
00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:05.800
At this time,

545
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.439
if you take care of her unconditionally,

546
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.839
it will definitely make
her like you more.

547
00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:18.000
Hi, Miss. Zhou.

548
00:24:18.199 --> 00:24:19.359
Mr. Gu asked me

549
00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:20.359
to hold the umbrella for you.

550
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.680
Do you need to follow me today?

551
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.640
What's wrong?

552
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.800
What's going on?

553
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.199
Can you stop following me?

554
00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:58.680
If the silent effort doesn't work,

555
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.880
then

556
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.280
you should make a grand one.

557
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.560
It is hard for girls to resist
a romantic moment

558
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.119
when all eyes are on her.

559
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.280
(There is a request to
arrange a proposal)

560
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.880
(at University of Nancheng.)

561
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.920
(It's at 8pm tonight.)

562
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.359
(Leave it to me.)

563
00:26:18.479 --> 00:26:19.119
It looks great.

564
00:26:21.199 --> 00:26:22.119
Hi, sir.

565
00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:23.479
The service fee is...

566
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.359
It's you.

567
00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:41.760
Were you the one

568
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.719
who requested these?

569
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:47.040
What are you trying to do?

570
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.719
Marry me.

571
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.280
It's a proposal!

572
00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:36.520
He's so handsome!

573
00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:38.000
It's so romantic!

574
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.400
Say yes.

575
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.920
It's so cool.

576
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.439
How I wish this would happen to me, too.

577
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:47.439
He's so handsome.

578
00:27:50.439 --> 00:27:51.400
Say yes.

579
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.119
No!

580
00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:55.520
Did she say no?

581
00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.359
How could she reject him?

582
00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:57.199
He's so handsome.

583
00:27:57.199 --> 00:27:57.839
I know

584
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.800
a girl

585
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.719
tends to feel nervous and shy

586
00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:03.479
at such a romantic moment.

587
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.479
I'll give you another five seconds

588
00:28:06.479 --> 00:28:07.439
to calm down.

589
00:28:12.239 --> 00:28:12.880
How is it?

590
00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:13.800
Are you ready?

591
00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:16.319
I'm calm now.

592
00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:19.119
No.

593
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.280
A girl

594
00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:26.400
acts shy in front of her suitor

595
00:28:26.599 --> 00:28:28.160
to get a definite answer.

596
00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:30.199
However, I'm sorry.

597
00:28:30.199 --> 00:28:30.959
I'm busy.

598
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.560
I don't have the time to
do it over and over again.

599
00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:34.479
I can tell you responsibly that

600
00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:35.239
I really mean it

601
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.599
when I say I want to marry you.

602
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.400
My time is precious, too.

603
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.839
Don't you understand my words?

604
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.920
I've told you that

605
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.439
I don't want to marry you.

606
00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:49.520
How could she reject him?

607
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.560
What a pity.

608
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.719
He's so handsome.

609
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.359
I would be glad to marry him.

610
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:56.920
She's back.

611
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.920
She must have regretted it.

612
00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.959
I don't want the ring.

613
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.959
The service fee is RMB2,000.

614
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.119
Here you go.

615
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.239
I've made the payment.

616
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.079
Therefore,

617
00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:05.599
can you consider my suggestion?

618
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520
Bye.

619
00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:48.040
Why didn't your suggestions work at all?

620
00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.239
I have a trump card.

621
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.400
A handbag.

622
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.760
It can solve every problem.

623
00:29:55.439 --> 00:29:57.640
What a grand scene.

624
00:29:57.719 --> 00:29:58.680
Didn't you see

625
00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.680
what happened last night?

626
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.280
There were firework and candles.

627
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.239
It's quite romantic.

628
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.680
Excuse me.

629
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.359
Excuse me.

630
00:30:05.239 --> 00:30:06.800
The guy looks handsome.

631
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.359
Miss. Zhou,

632
00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:08.359
these are the apology gifts

633
00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:09.800
prepared by Mr. Gu for you.

634
00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:22.599
Mr. Luo,

635
00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:23.359
let's begin.

636
00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:26.640
What about Mr. Gu?

637
00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:28.400
I'm sorry, Mr. Luo.

638
00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:29.760
Mr. Gu has something urgent today.

639
00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:31.920
Therefore, I'll chair the meeting
on behalf of him.

640
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.760
What a coincidence.

641
00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:38.479
I wanted to bring my team
from the animation department

642
00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:39.239
for observation.

643
00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:41.400
It's a pity that they can't
listen to Mr. Gu's talk.

644
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.520
Mr. Luo, you must be joking.

645
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.479
Let's talk

646
00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:44.839
about the progress of Lake Xingling.

647
00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:48.359
We've made some changes

648
00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:49.119
in the first two chapters.

649
00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:50.520
We've also changed

650
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.359
the personalities of some characters.

651
00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:53.760
In the male lead's dream
in the beginning,

652
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.520
we've added some fantasy elements.

653
00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:57.160
The image of the villain

654
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.520
has also become more concise.

655
00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:02.920
Hi, Miss.

656
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.839
May I know who you are looking for?

657
00:31:04.199 --> 00:31:05.199
Is Gu Nanzhou in?

658
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.000
Mr. Gu?

659
00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:07.280
Do you have an appointment?

660
00:31:07.959 --> 00:31:08.439
No.

661
00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:09.760
I'm sorry, Miss.

662
00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:11.719
Mr. Gu's day is packed.

663
00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:12.959
If you want to meet him,

664
00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:14.040
please make an appointment.

665
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.719
Tell him

666
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.359
I am Zhou Jianqing.

667
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.000
I have an important thing to tell him.

668
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.280
I'm sorry.

669
00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:22.599
No...

670
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.479
Hello.

671
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.359
Sure.

672
00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.319
Miss.

673
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.520
Miss.

674
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.280
Gu Nanzhou!

675
00:31:34.439 --> 00:31:35.079
Mr. Gu.

676
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920
Since you sent the gifts,

677
00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:46.040
why won't you see me?

678
00:31:54.439 --> 00:31:55.280
Hurry up.

679
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.479
I'm busy.

680
00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:01.959
You have been placing
your full attention

681
00:32:01.959 --> 00:32:03.040
on my life every day.

682
00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:04.599
I don't think you're busy.

683
00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:07.680
I only have a request.

684
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.520
Take back your gifts.

685
00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:12.239
Don't appear in front of me again.

686
00:32:12.959 --> 00:32:14.280
We'll talk about it next time.

687
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.839
Let me finish my work first.

688
00:32:16.239 --> 00:32:17.160
You may leave now.

689
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.319
No way!

690
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.040
You must give me

691
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.880
a satisfactory answer today.

692
00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:24.239
If not,

693
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.400
I won't leave your office.

694
00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:30.800
I can take back the gifts,

695
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.199
but you must promise me that

696
00:32:35.199 --> 00:32:35.959
you will marry me.

697
00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:39.760
Why must you marry me?

698
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.280
We have only known each
other for a few days.

699
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.680
It's because I am handsome, outstanding

700
00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:45.920
